-> Task Overview

This task focused on analyzing data using advanced SQL techniques. The aim was to find useful information and trends by using special SQL tools like subqueries, window functions, and CTEs (Common Table Expressions).

By completing this task, I learned how to write more powerful SQL queries that go beyond basic SELECT and JOIN statements. These queries are very useful for data reporting, trend analysis, and making data-driven decisions.

-> What I Did

I worked with a sample dataset that included two tables: one for product details and another for sales records. Using this data, I wrote SQL queries to:

- Calculate total and monthly sales
- Identify top-selling products
- Track how sales changed over time
- Break down complex logic into easy steps using CTEs

Instead of writing separate queries each time, I learned how to use one query inside another (called a subquery), or to calculate values across rows using window functions. This helped me analyze patterns more easily.

-> Tools Used

-MySQL – to create and query the database
-Visual Studio Code – as the code editor
-Word Document – to record the queries and explanations

->What’s in This Project

This project includes the following files:

- A Word document that contains all the SQL queries I wrote, with explanations for each
- A SQL file that creates the sample tables and inserts sample data
- This README file that explains the task and how I completed it

-> What I Learned

This task helped me understand the use of complex SQL features like:

- Subqueries – to find answers using results from other queries
- Window Functions – to calculate things like running totals and rankings
- CTEs – to break complex queries into smaller, easier-to-read parts

These skills are important when working with large datasets in real-world jobs. They allow you to answer more detailed questions from your data and generate meaningful reports.
